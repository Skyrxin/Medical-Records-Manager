# Medical Records Manager

## Overview

The **Medical Records Manager** is a Python-based tool designed to securely handle medical records using AES encryption for data protection. This project was developed as a collaborative effort between [skyrxin](https://github.com/skyrxin) and [Mido-Hyuga](https://github.com/Mido-Hyuga).

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Securely encrypts sensitive medical data.
- **Medical Record Management**: Handles storage, retrieval, and updates of medical records in a secure manner.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and easy to use, with a focus on privacy and security.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

1. **`aes_encryption.py`**: 
   - Contains functions for AES encryption and decryption to ensure that medical records are securely stored and transmitted.
   
2. **`medical-records-manager.py`**:
   - Manages medical records, enabling the creation, update, and deletion of records while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

## Installation

To install and use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skyrxin/Medical-Records-Manager.git
    cd Medical-Records-Manager
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python medical-records-manager.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Add or update medical records through the tool's interface.
2. All data is encrypted using AES encryption to ensure privacy.
3. Records can be retrieved and decrypted only by authorized users with access to the AES key.

## Future Improvements

- **UI Development**: Building a more user-friendly graphical interface for easier management of medical records.
- **Cloud Storage**: Integration with cloud storage services for remote access and storage.
- **Multi-user Support**: Enhancements for supporting multiple users with different access levels.
